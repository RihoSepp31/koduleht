# Koduleht

This is my personal website project that combines two of my passions: software development and cooking.

## 🔥 What this site includes
- 💻 **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- 📚 Various sections:
  - **Projects:** showcasing my software development work (Python, JavaScript, web)
  - **Recipes:** a taste of my creativity in the kitchen
  - **Fun corner:** small entertainment tools and games
- 🌐 Responsive design to work on all devices

## 🚀 Deployment
- Hosted on a server with Zone (Estonia).
- Public front-end code is available in this repository.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This repository contains only the front-end files.  
> Backend files (like `api.php`) and sensitive configurations are **kept private on the server** and excluded via `.gitignore`.
